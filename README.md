- âš¡ Fun fact: Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. This improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40-hour workweeks and youâ€™re putting in 100-hour workweeks, then even if youâ€™re doing the same thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve.
